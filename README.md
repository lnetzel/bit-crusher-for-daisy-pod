A Sample rate decimator and bit depth reducer for Daisy Pod hardware (using DaisyDuino)

Written by Lars Netzel with aid from of GPT-5 (ChatGPT)

Language: Arduino C++

How to use:
Plug stereo audio into Line in
Turning POT 1 clockwise will decimate more (48000 -> 100)
Turning POT 2 counter clockwise will reduce more bits (16 -> 2)
